        <p class="faq-text">
            As each state has different laws about gun ownership, you need to check with your local law enforcement if you have specific questions. We do our best to know the latest laws pertaining to guns, but if there is something we do not know, we will find the answer for you! Do not carry concealed unless you have a valid concealed carry permit. Because Alabama does have open carry, you can carry with your gun in open view! Remember that there are certain places where you cannot bring your firearm so check signage before walking into a place of business with your firearm. Your firearm is always welcome at Gold, Guns and Guitars!

    <div class="faq-question">
        What firearm will best help me in the arena of self-defense?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">
            To defend yourself you need a gun that is very easy to use and accurate. Smaller-framed guns are the easiest to conceal, but revolvers are more accurate and user-friendly. While revolvers are better for those who aren’t very familiar with guns, it is important to familiarize yourself with other firearms to advance and be able to safely carry more compact guns.

    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">
            Smaller guns are recommended for concealed carry. Feel free to stop by anytime and see which gun best fits you and will be easiest to keep in a hidden place on your person.

    <div class="faq-question">
        Should I use a long or short barrel?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">
            This is depends on how you use the gun. We would suggest you own a gun with a good balance, unless you want different guns for various jobs. The accuracy will increase with the length of the barrel. However, you can conceal short-barrel guns easier. Ultimately, the decision is up to you. It simply depends on how you wish to use it.

    <div class="faq-question">
        Should I own a high-capacity firearm?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">
            Most high-capacity firearms are harder to conceal but are more important to have in the case of an emergency or natural disaster. Consider what your needs are and why you are purchasing a gun.

    <div class="faq-question">
        What is a good beginner gun for someone?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">
            Smaller caliber guns work best when trying to teach someone how to shoot. This allows them to get the feel of a gun while teaching general gun safety practices. Starting smaller and practicing will deliver better results down the road.

    <div class="faq-question">
        What kind of pistols are good for smaller adults and women?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">
            Any kind! Some women prefer smaller guns, such as .380s, 9mm, etc., because they don’t recoil as much and they are more compact and easier to carry. We cannot stress enough how important it is to practice, practice, practice with your firearm! Familiarity will allow you to be comfortable and accurate in using your firearm.

        What is considered a concealed weapon?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">
            A concealed weapon is any lethal weapon that is hidden out of sight from another person is considered concealed. For example, if I carry a small .22 in my pocket, it is concealed. If I carry a .45 on my belt without a jacket, it is considered open carrying.

    <div class="faq-question">
        What types of safety features do guns have?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">
            Different guns have different safety features. For example, a Bersa Thunder .380 has a button to lock/unlock the trigger. A Para 1911 .45 has a grip safety to ensure the grip is being held while the trigger is being pulled, decreasing the chances of misfiring. Some require you have proper placement of your finger on the trigger to prevent misfiring. Most guns will have one or the other, or a combination of these different features.
