        What is a payday loan?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">A payday loan is a short-term, small dollar amount loan you intend to pay back once you receive your next paycheck. We know there are many situations that come up in between paychecks which you may not have been expecting. At Gold, Guns and Guitars we can help you solve those short-term financial situations by loaning you up to $500 on a 10-30 day term.

    <div class="faq-question">
        What do I need to get a loan?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">You will need to fill out a short loan application and verify your income (pay stub, W-2, etc.). Our staff will be able to help walk you through this process and if you are approved we can usually have you out the door, money in hand, in under half an hour.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        Can I renew my loan if I can’t pay it off?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">Yes! You will need to notify us two business days before the due date and we will be happy to roll the loan over. Just pay any amount between the minimum of the accrued interest and the full amount of the loan, and we will be happy to extend the remainder of your loan through another loan cycle.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        Will my information be kept private?
