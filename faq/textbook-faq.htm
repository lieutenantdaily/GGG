        <strong>Questions About Textbook Buybacks</strong>

    <div class="faq-question">
        What is a textbook buyback and how does it help me?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">Gold, Guns and Guitars buys textbooks directly from students. Usually, after final exams, you won’t need a textbook any more. By selling your books, you get cash for books you no longer need.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        When do you buy books back?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">We buy textbooks all year-round. We have always thought it’s better to buy all the time, rather than doing like some bookstores who only buy around finals. If we’re open, we’re buying!
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        Will I get more money for books at finals than other times?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">It often works this way at other stores. But at Gold, Guns and Guitars, most of the time you don’t get a higher price at finals. In fact, you might get less. It usually pays to sell books as soon as you don’t need them anymore.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        Will you buy books that are missing CDs, access codes, workbooks, or other components?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">Unfortunately, we are unable to buy most of these items if the book requires them. Sometimes books and access codes are packaged together but can be bought independently of one another. CDs that come in a separate case from the book can usually be bought separate as well. However, if the CD, access code, or other component comes inside the book as a part of the book it is required for us to be able to take it in on buyback.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        Can I sell a book that is damaged or has excessive writing or markings?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">We buy damaged books on a case-by-case basis. Some we can still buy, though at a reduced price due to condition. Others are just in too bad of shape to be sold and used again. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Excessive writing and markings are usually OK, but the price we offer will be much lower than for the same book in good condition. Sometimes, there are books with extreme amounts of marks and mess than we simply can’t buy.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        Are there any types of books you cannot buy?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">We do not buy the following:
        </p>        
        <p class="faq-text">
            <ul style="list-style-type:square; font-size: 18px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 45px;">
                <li>International editions</li>
                <br>
                <li>Instructor’s editions (Note: If your book has black tape on the cover anywhere, it’s probably an instructor’s edition)</li>
                <br>
                <li>Free copies, professional copies, complementary copies, review copies (these are sample books given to instructors by the publishers)</li>
                <br>
                <li>Counterfeit or pirated copies of books</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        How do I sell my textbooks to Gold, Guns and Guitars?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">You’ll need to gather all your books together that you no longer need. Also, please bring any CDs, unused access codes, and any other accessories that go with the books. We often need these items to include with the book when we sell it. In addition, sometimes having these items will get you extra money. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The next step is to bring all the books inside the store, to the counter. We’ll check them out, see what their value is, and make you an offer.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        What if my school isn’t using a textbook again next semester?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">If the book still has value elsewhere, we’ll buy it. Students from other schools will be using it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        How much money will I get?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">This depends on a bunch of factors: whether the book is a current edition, how easy or difficult it is for us to sell, whether it’s going to be used again by local colleges, how much other book companies will pay us for it, how many copies we have already, and so on. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We often pay between $5 and $60. A large percentage of these fall between $20 and $40.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        How do I get paid?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">Cash, baby, cash! We pay in cash because it’s easiest for you.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        Is it a good idea to keep books “for reference” later?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">Sometimes, but there is one major mistake lots of people make: they keep the books, but they don’t actually use them in many cases. Realizing this, they’ll come to sell these books many years after their classes ended. By that time, a new edition of the books has been published, and the books from their college days are outdated and not worth any money. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There’s no sense in missing out on hundreds of dollars in buybacks, or having books clutter your house for years and then get nothing. We don’t want that to happen to you! Our advice is that you be absolutely sure you’ll use a book in the future before you decide to keep it. Otherwise, it needs to be sold ASAP before the publishers get a chance to produce a new edition. 
            <br>
            <br>
            You can often find a cheap copy of the book you used in class after a couple years pass. That edition goes old, and people are willing to part with it very cheap. The idea is for you to sell when the book is current and worth perhaps $50, then buy it for $10 or less later on. This way, you pocket $40 and will have a copy for the future if you need it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        Do you buy unused access codes?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">Yes. Codes often have some value. If you have an unused code, please bring it in.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        Do you buy books that are not college textbooks?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">Yes, but they’re usually not worth very much. You might get $1 to $10 per book. We sometimes buy an occasional high school book or home school textbook.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        How many copies of a book can you buy from me?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">Multiple copies are fine. We’ll buy as many as we think we can sell.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        What if my books don’t have any market value?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">We can’t buy them, but you can keep them, discard them, or give them away.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        I have a ton of books. Is it OK if I bring them all?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">Yes. But it may not be best to bring them all. Most books that were published before 2005 are not worth any money, so there’s no reason to bring them. It’s better to just bring the ones from 2005 to the present.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        Do you pay more than other stores?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">Yes, pretty often. We don’t promise to beat everybody every time, but we will do our best to see that the best price is offered! 
            <br>
            <br>
            It’s fine to compare buyback prices, but it will take you some time and effort to go to multiple stores. If you do get a higher offer at another store, please let us know and we’ll see if we can beat it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
        Is there any good reason not to sell my books?
    </div>
    <div class="faq-text">
        <p class="faq-text">There are a couple things to watch out for when you go to sell textbooks. To start with, you’ll want to be sure that you won’t need the book again in a future class. You don’t want to sell the book back, then have to turn around and buy it again at a higher price. 
            <br>
            <br>
            On occasional titles, it may be a good idea to keep a book rather than sell it. For instance, a nursing student might keep a drug guide that she’ll use at the hospital later on. Also, some books just don’t have much value at buyback, and if you’re only getting a few bucks for a book, it might be better to just hang on to it.
