            <h1>About Us</h1>

            <p class="block1-text">
                Gold, Guns and Guitars is
                <span class="strong">new</span>,
                <span class="strong">modern</span>,
                <span class="strong">clean</span>, and
                <span class="strong">organized</span>. Seriously, pawn shops shouldn’t have to look so shady!
                <br>
                <br>More than anything, we are
                <span class="strong">affordable</span>. You are obviously looking for a deal, so we won’t take a year old tool that sells new for $100 and price it at $85! That’s ridiculous! We'll price it at $60 so you’ll buy it!
                <br>
                <br>We also offer high-quality
                <span class="strong">gunsmithing</span>. Our services include: barrel bluing, gun cleaning, scope mounting, bore sighting, and much more! All this for $40 per hour, or a low flat fee, depending on the service.
                <br>
                <br>We will be happy to
                <span class="strong">buy</span>&nbsp;your item as well as
                <span class="strong">loan</span>&nbsp;on it. Bring in your jewelry, gun, electronic item, tool, or anything else of value for a cash offer!
