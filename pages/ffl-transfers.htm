                <p class="block1-text">
                    Because of the USA PATRIOT Act it is illegal to buy a handgun outside of your state of residency and transport it into your home state. While we would like to be your only source for buying guns, we know realistically there will be times when you find a deal on a used gun online that we may not currently have in stock, and laws require that all guns purchased online, whether long-gun or pistol, be received by a licensed dealer.

                <p class="block1-text">
                    We are happy to help you maneuver around these roadblocks by providing FFL transfer services in Florence, AL. This allows a licensed firearms dealer to ship a gun to another licensed firearms dealer in another state where you can conveniently pick it up. We know prices and regulations are already too high when buying guns, so while most other dealers charge $25 and up to provide this service, we charge a low $15 fee to send or receive. Multiple gun transfers are $10 for the second gun, and $7.50 for each additional gun. We charge a small shipping fee to send a firearm. Additionally, we will waive this nominal fee if you have purchased the gun from us, and all you will have to pay is the shipping cost, no added fees.
